# Valheim Dedicated Server - Docker Image and Helm Chart
This Docker image provides a [Valheim](https://www.valheimgame.com/) dedicated game server.
You will also find a [Helm chart](https://helm.sh/) here for running a Valheim dedicated server on [Kubernetes container orchestration system](https://kubernetes.io/).

My automation checks the [Valheim public branch](https://steamdb.info/app/896660/depots/?branch=public) every
night. If a new release was published by [Iron Gate Studios](https://irongate.se/), a new Docker image will be built
with this new version. Just use the `latest` tag and you will always have an up-to-date Docker image. No need to
manually run any server updates and mess around with your Docker image. It's that simple. :smiley:

Have a look at the [docker compose example](examples/docker-compose/compose.yaml) and
[its documentation](examples/docker-compose#automated-server-updates).
There you can see how a server update can be automated with a simple script.
You can also read [my blog article for setting up your own Valheim server with Docker and Docker Compose](https://max-pfeiffer.github.io/how-to-set-up-a-valheim-dedicated-server-using-docker-and-docker-compose.html)
for getting some further instructions.

Kudos to:
* [@jonakoudijs](https://github.com/jonakoudijs) for providing the [Steamcmd Docker image](https://github.com/steamcmd/docker) which is used here

**Docker Hub:** https://hub.docker.com/r/pfeiffermax/valheim-dedicated-server

**GitHub Repository:** https://github.com/max-pfeiffer/valheim-dedicated-server-docker-helm

## Usage
### Configuration
You can append all [Valheim console commands](https://www.valheimgame.com/support/a-guide-to-dedicated-servers/) as arguments
when running the `valheim_server.x86_64` binary. Use the regular syntax like `-name ValheimServer` or `-public 1`.

As the Valheim server is running in the Docker container as a stateless application, you want to have all stateful server
data (config, saves, etc.) stored in a [Docker volume](https://docs.docker.com/engine/storage/volumes/)
which is persisted **outside** the container. This can be configured with `-savedir`: you can specify the
directory where this data is stored. You need to make sure that this directory is mounted on
a [Docker Volume](https://docs.docker.com/engine/storage/volumes/).

This is especially important because you need to update the Valheim server image every month when
[Iron Gate Studios](https://irongate.se/) releases a new software update. When you use a
[Docker volume](https://docs.docker.com/engine/storage/volumes/) to store the `-savedir`, all the data is still intact.

### Docker Run
For testing purposes, you can fire up a Docker container like this:
```shell
docker run -it --publish 2456:2456/udp --publish 2457:2457/udp pfeiffermax/valheim-dedicated-server:latest -name ValheimServer -world NewWorld -password supersecret -public 0
```

### Docker Compose
Please have a look at the [docker compose example](examples/docker-compose/README.md).

### Podman Compose on a remote builder
The image is built with [Podman](https://podman.io/). If you want to build and run it yourself on a
remote linux/amd64 Podman host — handy on an arm64 machine, where the 32-bit x86 `steamcmd` binary
used in the image build cannot be emulated — have a look at the
[podman compose remote builder example](examples/podman-compose-remote-builder/README.md).

## Helm chart
If you would like to run the Valheim server in your [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) cluster, I provide a
[Helm chart](https://helm.sh/) you could use: [https://max-pfeiffer.github.io/valheim-dedicated-server-docker-helm](https://max-pfeiffer.github.io/valheim-dedicated-server-docker-helm)

There is also [documentation available](charts/valheim/README.md) for that Helm chart.
It covers per-instance [world modifiers](charts/valheim/README.md#world-modifiers) and
[Helm-managed player lists](charts/valheim/README.md#player-lists), available starting with chart version 1.3.0.

The chart and container image are released independently. Chart releases use the version in
[`Chart.yaml`](charts/valheim/Chart.yaml), which must be bumped manually for chart changes;
release-please manages the project version and excludes the chart. Container images use
`build-<Steam build ID>` and `latest` tags.

If you want to run your Valheim server on bare metal Kubernetes, check out
[my blog article](https://max-pfeiffer.github.io/hosting-game-servers-on-bare-metal-kubernetes-with-cilium-as-cni.html)
on how to do that using [Cilium](https://cilium.io/).
